# mbw-native-py3
An experiment to make native WRECK + modSys compatible with python 3

After porting [niDiplomacy](https://github.com/iniznet/niDiplomacy) based on Diplado, I noticed something went wrong, so I think I will go with native this time to make sure it not occured by native itself.

Only need WRECK python 3 compatible? [mbw-wreck-py3](https://github.com/iniznet/mbw-wreck-py3).
You might want to use builder helpers to help you develop your mod easier and make code more readable, [mbw-helpers](https://github.com/iniznet/mbw-helpers).

## TODO
- [x] Port WRECK to python 3
- [x] Port modSys to python 3
- [ ] Modularize modSys into separate folder, to make it easier to maintain (Waiting for important builder helpers to be ready)
- [ ] Add more documentation

## Known issues
So far, I don't find any issue, but I'm not sure if it's because I'm not using it enough. If you find any issue, please report it, or even better, fix it and make a pull request.
